<p class="para">TSA is an organization of over 200,000 students and advisors devoted to helping students explore fields in STEM through over 60 annual competitive events. These events range in topic from website design, building catapults and small solar-powered cars, digital photography, to public speaking.

The opportunities afforded by the wide range of event offerings creates opportunities for students with varied interests to not only explore their interest, but also to branch out to others. Many alumni have gone on to diverse STEM careers because of TSA. Additionally, events help make what is taught in the classroom more applicable, and teach skills that are useful in STEM-related disciplines.

At the end of every year of preparation, students travel to the TSA National Competition, an event of thousands of students where they finish the year of TSA. Most events are at least partially, if not entirely, "on site" events, requiring, for example, an interview to defend their video game, a debate, or building their event on the spot. This year, the TSA National Conference is in Dallas, Texas, a long ways from Ithaca.

In Ithaca High School TSA, we sign up for and compete in TSA competitive events. Historically, we've been very successful at both the state and national levels, winning a pile of awards at states and four at nationals.
